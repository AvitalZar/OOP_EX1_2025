classes changed:
GameLogic
Position
Move
Disc
BombDisc
SimpleDisc
UnflippableDisc.


I added printings in the classes GameLogic, Move, and Position.
For print flips documentations, I added "position" fild in Disc, because flippedDisc return disc and we need to print position (and it was easier than fix flippedDisc).
